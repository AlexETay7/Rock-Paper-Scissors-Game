# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
In this project I made a simple rock paper scissors game using Python! I have never used Python before nor have I taken any classes in it. I am trying to teach myself. 

# Overview
As you might expect, the game is pretty self-explanatory. Enter your name, then start playing. If you want to play again enter yes, if you don't enter no. Enjoy!
