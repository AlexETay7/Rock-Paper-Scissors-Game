# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
In this project, I made a simple rock-paper-scissors game using Python! I have never used Python before nor have I taken any classes in it. I am trying to teach myself. 

### ***Overview***
As you might expect, the game is pretty self-explanatory. Enter your name, then start playing. If you want to play again enter yes, if you don't enter no. Enjoy!

### ***Compiling and Running***
To run the program in a terminal, navigate to the directory where you have the repository saved and type the following command:
<pre>
$ python3 RPC.py
</pre>

If this does not work, do:
<pre>
$ python RPC.py
</pre>

From here just follow along with the prompts and try to win!

*Note that the '$' character is not typed, that's just to symbolize being in the terminal*
